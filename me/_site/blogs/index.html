      <p>1. Use Arrays.asList() Let's first looks its JAVA API below. We get that it returns a **fixed size List** 1 @SafeVarargs 2 public static &lt;T&gt; List&lt;T&gt; asList(T... a) 3 Returns a fixed-size list backed by the specified array. (Changes to the returned list &quot;write through&quot; to the array.) This method...</p>

      <p>Other names in computer science: digital tree, radix tree, prefix tree. The term trie comes from retrieval. It is pronounced like "try" by some, like "tree" (the pronunciation of "trie" in "retrieval") by others. We use a trie to store pieces of data that have a key and possibly a...</p>

      <p>What is Tmux: Tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals, each running a separate program to be created, accessed and controlled from a single screen. Motivation: Considering that you have a lot of work to do in the same time use terminal, you might want to...</p>

      <p>Reservoir sampling is a family of randomized algorithms for randomly choosing a sample of k items from a list S containing n items, where n is either a very large or unknown number. Typically n is large enough that the list doesn't fit into main memory(From wiki). Goal: Without knowing...</p>

      <p>A linear time majority vote algorithm. A majority element in an array is an element that apepears more than size/2 times. Basic idea: we cancel out each occurrence of an element e with all other element that are different from e. Then e exit till end if e is a...</p>

      <p>About KMP KMP algorithm is one of string search algorithm. Given two strings(generally one long text, one short pattern), deternmine whether one string (the pattern) appears in the other string. For example: given one string "ABCCEFGHI", check if it contains "CEF". We can solve this problem by doing naive string...</p>

      <p>About morris traversal It aims at traversing an binary tree in inorder without using stack. The main idea: Create links to the successor(use leaf node's left or right null pointer) Print the data using these links Revert the changes to restore original tree. Inorder Example Let's explain inorder traversal as...</p>

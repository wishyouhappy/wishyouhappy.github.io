<p>What is Tmux:</p>

<p>Tmux is a terminal multiplexer: it enables a number of terminals, each running a separate program to be created, accessed and controlled from a single screen.</p>

<p>Motivation:</p>

<p>Considering that you have a lot of work to do in the same time use terminal, you might want to create a lot of tabs. One solution for this problem is the terminal multiplexer. </p>


<p>How it works</p>

<p> Tmux is developed on a client-server model. A session is a single collection of pseudo terminals under the management of tmux. Each session hasone or more windows linked to it. A window occupies the entire screen and may be split into rectangular
panes, each of which is a separate pseudo terminal. Any number of tmux instances may connect to the
same session, and any number of windows may be present in the same session. Once all sessions are
killed, tmux exits.</p>

<h2> How to use it</h2>

<p>
1) Install

Use yum, homebrew, port, apt-get or whatever package manage tools to install.

</p>
<p>
2) Create a session/Attach a session/ detach a session /kill a session
</p>


<div class="code-block">
{% highlight java %} 
tmux new-session -s sessionname

tmux attch-session -t sessionname

tmux detach

tmux kill-session -t sessionname

tmux list-clients    // list all clients

tmux kill-server // kill server will kill all clients
 {% endhighlight %}
 </div>

 <p><strong> If we don't add session name, it will default number to 0, 1, 2, ....</strong></p>
<h2> Some quick key</h2>


<pre>
1) <strong>Sessions</strong>

C-b s  --- Select a new session for the attached client interactively.
C-b d  --- Detach the current client.

2) <strong>Windows</strong>
 
C-b c  --- Create a new window.
C-b [0-9]  --- Select windows 0 to 9.
C-b &  --- Kill the current window.

3)  <strong>Panes</strong>

C-b %  --- Split the current pane into two, left and right.
C-b "  --- Split the current pane into two, top and bottom.
C-b C-o  ---  Rotate the panes in the current window forwards.
C-b x  ---  Kill the current pane.
